WorldChat
We think someone is trying to transmit a flag over WorldChat. Unfortunately, there are so many other people talking that we can't really keep track of what is going on! Go see if you can find the messenger at shell2017.picoctf.com:61161. Remember to use Ctrl-C to cut the connection if it overwhelms you!


began to run this command nc shell2017.picoctf.com 61161 > output.txt

and then did less output.txt and searched for /flag and got
21:50:12 flagperson: this is part 1/8 of the flag - 1a2e
21:53:48 flagperson: this is part 2/8 of the flag - 3d0a
21:53:51 flagperson: this is part 3/8 of the flag - 6310
21:53:54 flagperson: this is part 4/8 of the flag - 682c
21:53:57 flagperson: this is part 5/8 of the flag - 6be0
21:54:05 flagperson: this is part 6/8 of the flag - e319
21:54:09 flagperson: this is part 7/8 of the flag - d1b5
21:54:10 flagperson: this is part 8/8 of the flag - 2f53

FLAG -> 1a2e3d0a6310682c6be0e319d1b52f53

***UPDATE***

If you knew the name -> "flagperson"

nc shell2017.picoctf.com 61161 | grep "flagperson"

and get the same output
